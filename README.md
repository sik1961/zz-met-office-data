Store and analyse Met Office historic data
This project reads historic weather data from the Met Office's web site and stores it for analysis and reporting.

Recent update changes the output to Excel spreadsheet format making for easier manipulation of data.
3 files are produced:-
1. Historic Data for all stations.
2. Yearly Averages for all stations.
3. Extremes for all stations.
